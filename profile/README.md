# üßä Polar Geophysical Simulation Lab (PGSL)
### Georgia Institute of Technology

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Polar Geophysical Simulation Lab** - where cutting-edge geophysics meets machine learning to unlock the secrets of Earth's polar regions.

## üéØ Our Mission

We're tackling one of the most pressing challenges of our time: understanding how polar ice sheets respond to climate change. Through innovative combinations of **geophysical surveys**, **machine learning**, and **numerical modeling**, we're building the scientific foundation needed to predict future ice sheet behavior and sea level rise.

## üî¨ What We Do

### **Field Research Adventures**
- Deploy state-of-the-art geophysical equipment in Greenland and Antarctica
- Collect radar and seismic data to peer beneath kilometers of ice
- Investigate ice sheet internal structures and basal conditions in some of Earth's most remote locations

### **AI-Powered Discovery**
- Develop machine learning algorithms to extract insights from complex geophysical datasets
- Create automated tools for processing and interpreting ice-penetrating radar data
- Build predictive models that reveal hidden patterns in polar ice behavior

### **Advanced Modeling**
- Integrate field observations with numerical ice sheet models
- Improve climate projections by incorporating real-world geophysical constraints
- Bridge the gap between observations and predictions


## üìã Current Projects

Our GitHub repositories showcase active research in:
- **User-Guided Calibration Tools**: Making geophysical data processing more accessible
- **Python Development**: Building robust analysis pipelines with comprehensive documentation
- **Interactive Visualization**: Jupyter notebooks with advanced plotting capabilities
- **Documentation Enhancement**: Professional technical writing and visual design
